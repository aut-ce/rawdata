RAW Files of Repositories

## Whats?
In this project, large files that are used in other projects are placed. For each project there is a folder in seperate branch with same name of that project.

For example, The RAW data of `CE202-LC-Lab-Manual` Repository placed in `[..]/rawdata/CE202-LC-Lab-Manual/CE202-LC-Lab-Manual/`.

## How to Use

* **Method 1**

When you view a file it has a link to the "raw" version. The URL is constructed like so:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repository/branch/filename
```

* **Method 2**
If you go to the page and view the links provided by "raw" (in the top left corner, when viewing the file). You will see, that you can access it by:
```
https://github.com/username/repository/raw/$changeset_hash/path/to/file
```
Instead of $changeset_hash you can also provide a branch (e.g. master) or tag.

**Example:** Download link for ProblemSet 5 of CE202-PDS Course:
```
https://github.com/aut-ce/rawdata/raw/CE242-PDS/2021-Spring/pdf/PDS-ProblemSet-5.pdf
```
