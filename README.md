RAW Files of Repositories

## Whats?
In this project, large files that are used in other projects are placed. For each project there is a folder in seperate branch with same name of that project.

For example, The RAW data of `CE202-LC-Lab-Manual` Repository placed in `[..]/rawdata/CE202-LC-Lab-Manual/CE202-LC-Lab-Manual/`.

## How to Use
When you view a file it has a link to the "raw" version. The URL is constructed like so:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repository/branch/filename
```
## License
Whole Project has MIT License but Each Project (Folder) has Its own License.
